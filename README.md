I'm thinking of making a website that helps people to find artists to commission. It would function like a search engine, directing the user to artist profiles with commission info, types of commissions available, example work, and links to their other websites. This website would not process payments. It would essentially exist to redirect buyers to the websites you choose. Its key features would include:

- **Tag-based search** for easy filtering of artists by theme, price, and medium
- Artist recommendations for similar artists to given profile (not AI-based)
- **Total data autonomy** so your profile data can be transferred over to an equivalent site with a better design if one is created; your data can also be self-hosted, so it can be really and truly yours
- **No lock-in whatsoever**, since it exists to describe your work, and forward interested traffic to the websites you like to use for payment and portfolios
- **Open-source code** which makes suggestions easy to submit and more likely to be applied
- **Free to use, for all features** (no "premium" tier)

I'm still trying to determine a solid feature set for this website, so I have [a survey]() you can take so I can make sure this is of use to people.
